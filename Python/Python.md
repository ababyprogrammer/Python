# Python

In this code, the **script** performs the following steps:

1. Logs in to the BukaLapak account.
2. Retrieves all the item IDs of the user.
3. Retrieves the title and price of each item.
4. Simulates the daily sales for each item and calculates the daily earnings.
5. Prints the daily earnings of each user.

The code uses a realistic delay (between 5 and 10 seconds) to simulate human behavior while browsing the website. The daily sales are simulated randomly using the `randint` function.

The threads are not necessary in this code because the delays already simulate a non-blocking behavior.

The script handles potential errors like network issues, incorrect login credentials, or missing data on the web page. The `requests` library automatically manages cookies and sessions, ensuring that each user is correctly identified during the entire process.

To make the code more efficient and realistic, the daily sales could be fetched from a real database instead of simulating them randomly. The `threading` library could also be used to process multiple users simultaneously.

Note: The BukaLapak API should be used to retrieve such information as user sales data, instead of scraping their website. The code provided is only for educational purposes and may not be legally compliant or suitable for all use cases.
