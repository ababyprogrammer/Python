Here is an example of a Python function that follows a clean, modular, and professional code structure:

`Click on clean.py`

In this example, the function is documented using docstrings. This helps users understand what the function does, what parameters it expects, and what it returns. The code also includes a check to ensure that the input is a positive integer, raising a `ValueError` if it is not. This demonstrates proper error handling in Python.

Furthermore, the function's name and structure follow Python's PEP 8 naming and style conventions. These conventions help ensure that the code is consistent, readable, and adheres to the broader Python community's best practices.

In terms of testing, you can use the `doctest` module to test the function with the provided examples:

``` text copy
import doctest
doctest.testmod()
```

This command will automatically search for and execute the test cases provided in the function's docstring.

Remember, while it's important to follow a consistent coding style and ensure your code is well-documented, the most important aspect of professional code is its ability to effectively solve the problem at hand.
